                GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and
                collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects
                from anywhere.A repository is usually used to organize a single
                project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images,
                videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project
                needs. Often, repositories include a README file, a file with
                information about your project.

                Webflow is a website design tool to help people build websites
                without having to worry about coding. With a drag-and-drop
                interface, the user builds the site they want in the editor, and
                when itâ€™s finished Webflow automatically generates the
                appropriate HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
